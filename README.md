# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## This is Vallimayl V from EEE second year. pronouns: she/her.
### I have interests in robotics, computer vision, competitive programming, open-sourcing, ML, embedded systems and electronics (but not restricted only to these domains) and still I'm exploring these domains.
I love to explore all field related to STEM.
I hope I'll learn a lot about all the tech domains in the upcoming days.
